# Current Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) release notes (January 2023)

**Last update**: January 5, 2023

Customer Journey Analytics releases operate on a [continuous delivery model](releases.md) which allows for a more scalable, phased approach to feature deployment. Accordingly, these release notes get updated several times a month. Please check them regularly.

The Preferences page now contains the following new tabs, each containing many new configuration options:<ul><li>Freeform table</li><li>Visualizations>/li></ul>. In addition, more preferences are now available on the **[!UICONTROL General]** and **[!UICONTROL Project]** tabs.<p>Previously, many of these preferences were configurable only for individual projects, tables, and visualizations.

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Improved IP-to-geolocation mapping** | September 29, 2022 | Adobe's vendor for IP lookups, Digital Element, is upgrading to a new improved dataset (NetAcuity Pulse) for IP-to-geolocation mapping. Adobe Analytics has postponed the adoption of this new dataset to **January 11, 2023**. The new database will be more accurate than previous versions. Some IP-to-geo mappings will change/improve when the new database is adopted.<p> CJA data provided through the [!UICONTROL Analytics Source Connector] will also automatically take advantage of the new mappings. |
