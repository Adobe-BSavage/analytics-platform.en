# Current Adobe Customer Journey Analytics release notes (March 2024)

**Last update**: March 7, 2024

These release notes cover the release period of end of March 13, 2024 through April 2024. Adobe Customer Journey Analytics releases operate on a [continuous delivery model](releases.md) which allows for a more scalable, phased approach to feature deployment. Accordingly, these release notes get updated several times a month. Please check them regularly.

## New or updated features 

| Feature | Description | [Rollout starts](releases.md) | [General Availability](releases.md) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Usage metrics** | The usage metrics interface shows the usage of ingested and reportable rows across all connections. This interface lets you determine whether your Customer Journey Analytics usage complies with what is contractually agreed upon. | February 20, 2024 | March 13, 2024 |
| **Media Analytics Reporting - Average Minute Audience (AMA)** | The Average Minute Audience panel is now available in CJA. Media Analytics customers can use the Average Minute Audience panel to better understand average consumption of their content. Average minute audience enables comparisons of programming of any length or genre. In addition, customers can compare or append this digital average minute audience to linear TV average minute metrics. This panel gives more flexibility to measure the average audience for custom time periods, as well as when the duration classification has been updated after the fact. |  | March 12, 2024 |
| **B2B Schema Transformation for Person to Account** | Lets you transform datasets to better support person-based lookups in Customer Journey Analytics B2B reporting scenarios. This capability is available for datasets for B2B schemas based on the following classes:<ul><li>XDM Business Account Person Relation</li><li>XDM Business Opportunity Person Relation</li><li>XDM Business Marketing List Members</li><li>XDM Business Campaign Members</li></ul> | | March 26, 2024 |
| **Adobe Product Analytics: Compare events within a single Funnel step** | In the Funnel: Friction view, you can now compare events within a single funnel step. This is particularly useful when your journey has step options or a step where an A/B experiment is being run. | March 29, 2024 | April 12, 2024 |
| **Administrators can manage all locations in their organization** | A new option on the Locations page allows Administrators to view and manage all locations in the organization. Previously, administrators could view and manage only the locations they created. | | April 2024 |
| **Audiences are published to a new "Audiences" section in Experience Platform** | Audiences that are published from Customer Journey Analytics are now available in the new "Audiences" section in Experience Platform. Previously, audiences that were published from Customer Journey Analytics were available in Platform under the "Segments" section. This improvement provides the following benefits:<ul><li>Audiences no longer have a 1-hour delay before they appear in Platform; they are available seconds after they are published.</li><li>Audiences can be sorted in Platform by using the "Origin" column, which displays the application from which the audience was originally published.</li><li>Filter and sort options in Platform enable you to more quickly find the relevant audiences.</li></ul>For more information, see the section [Use Customer Journey Analytics audiences in Experience Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-components/audiences/publish.html?lang=en#audiences-aep).|  | April 2024 |
| **Experience Edge bot detection** | [Bot detection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/datastreams/bot-detection.html) allows you to identify events generated by Web SDK, Mobile SDK and Server API as being generated by known spiders and bots. | | April 29, 2024 |

| Adobe API object member additions  | January 17, 2024 |  Adobe may add optional request and response members (name/value pairs) to existing API objects without notice or changes in versioning. Such additions should be non-breaking changes for your implementation. Adobe recommends that you refer to the API documentation of any third-party tool you integrate with our APIs so that such additions are ignored in processing if not understood. Adobe will not remove parameters or add required parameters without first providing standard notification through release notes. |
