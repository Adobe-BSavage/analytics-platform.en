| **Journey canvas visualization** | Journey canvas is a visualization in Analysis workspace that allows you to analyze how people proceed through or fall out of a defined journey. Build analyses of user journeys by creating a flexible graph of nodes and arrows representing any combination of events, dimension items, and filters. Drag nodes on the canvas to rearrange the events and conditions of the journey. As you do, data updates accordingly.<p>Customers with access to Adobe Journey Optimizer can analyze existing Journey Optimizer journeys.<p>To learn more about Journey canvas, see [Journey canvas overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-workspace/visualizations/journey-canvas/journey-canvas).<p>To learn how to build a Journey canvas visualization, see [Configure Journey canvas](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-workspace/visualizations/journey-canvas/configure-journey-canvas). |  October 2, 2024 | October 14, 2024  |
| **Panel filters and column filters are now included when creating an audience** | When creating an audience from a visualization within Analysis Workspace, panel filters and column filters are now included as additional criteria. If the filters aren't needed, they can be removed prior to publishing the audience. Previously, any filters applied to the panel or to the column of a visualization in Analysis Workspace were ignored when creating an audience.<p>For information about how to create an audience from Customer Journey Analytics, see [Create and publish audiences](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-components/audiences/publish). |  | October 2, 2024 |
