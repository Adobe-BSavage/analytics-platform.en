Note: Wildcard searching does not yet work at the dimension item level. | October 21, 2021 |

| Feature | [General Availability](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/landing/an-releases.html?lang=en) - Target Date | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| [!UICONTROL Device] and [!UICONTROL Geography] dimensions | October 30, 2020 | These dimensions are now available by default as part of the [Standard Lookup](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-connections/standard-lookups.html) support project in the Adobe Analytics [!UICONTROL Source Connector]. This much-requested addition increases [parity between Adobe Analytics and CJA](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-overview/cja-aa.html?lang=en#cja-overview). |
| Journey IQ: [!UICONTROL Cross-Channel Analytics] | January 11, 2021 | Journey IQ: [!UICONTROL Cross-Channel Analytics] enables you to rekey an Adobe Analytics (or other) event dataset in Experience Platform data lake from one ID namespace to another. Typically, you can rekey the event dataset from a cookie-based ID to a person-based ID. This way, the rekeyed dataset can be combined with other person-based data in a CJA connection, thus enabling cross-device and cross-channel analysis in Analysis Workspace.
