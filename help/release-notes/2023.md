| **Row/column filtering for Analytics Source Connector streaming** | The Analytics Source Connector in Adobe Experience Platform now allows for filtering of Analytics data which is used to populate profiles in [Real-Time Customer Profile](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/home.html?lang=en). Row-level filtering helps reduce the number of events associated with profiles. Column-level filtering helps reduce the richness of the events themselves, thus enabling you to optimize the use of profile entitlements. This filtering applies only to data sent to Real-Time Customer Profile and [Identity Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/identity/home.html?lang=en). **Filtering does not impact the data which is sent to Data Lake for use in applications such as Customer Journey Analytics**.
