# 2022 Customer Journey Analytics release notes

## January 2022 {#jan2022}

## Key updates

| Feature | Description | Targeted Date |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
|[!UICONTROL Persistence] options for binding dimensions and binding metrics| When creating or editing a data view, you can bind the persistence of a dimension to another dimension or metric. This concept is known as _merchandising_ in Reports & Analytics, and is now supported in CJA.

## Other updates

| Feature | Description | Targeted Date |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| [!UICONTROL First Known] and [!UICONTROL Last Known] allocation models | These two new allocation models take the first or last observed value for a dimension within a specified persistence scope (session, person, or custom time period with look-back.) Then they apply the allocation model to all events within the specified scope.

| [!UICONTROL PersonID] and [!UICONTROL PersonID namespace] as dimensions | Exposes the `personID` (or `customerID`, or whatever ID you are using for merging data sets in a connection) as a dimension in data views. This enhancement makes it easier for you to include the `personID` as a dimension in your data view by pulling it in from the connection.
