| Mobile scorecard project preview mode | Launch a preview of how your mobile scorecard will look in the Analytics dashboards app, directly from the scorecard builder. The preview mode allows users to interact with filters and charts in the same way they would in the app, allowing them to preview the experience before they save and share the scorecard. Users can also use the device picker in preview mode to see how their scorecard will look on different devices.

| Feature | Description | Targeted Date |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
|[!UICONTROL Persistence] options for binding dimensions and binding metrics| When creating or editing a data view, you can bind the persistence of a dimension to another dimension or metric. This concept is known as _merchandising_ in Reports & Analytics, and is now supported in CJA. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/component-settings/persistence.html#binding-dimension) and [use case](/help/use-cases/binding-dimensions-metrics.md)| January 19, 2022 |
| [!UICONTROL First Known] and [!UICONTROL Last Known] allocation models | These two new allocation models take the first or last observed value for a dimension within a specified persistence scope (session, person, or custom time period with look-back.) Then they apply the allocation model to all events within the specified scope. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/component-settings/persistence.html#allocation-settings)| January 19, 2022 |
| [!UICONTROL PersonID] and [!UICONTROL PersonID namespace] as dimensions | Exposes the `personID` (or `customerID`, or whatever ID you are using for merging data sets in a connection) as a dimension in data views. This enhancement makes it easier for you to include the `personID` as a dimension in your data view by pulling it in from the connection.
