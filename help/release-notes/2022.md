| Data prep for Analytics Source Connector | The [Analytics Source Connector](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/ui-tutorials/create/adobe-applications/analytics.html) is now integrated with the [Data Prep](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-prep/home.html) capabilities provided by Adobe Experience Platform. Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (RTCDP), CJA and Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO) customers can now extend the Analytics field group with additional field groups. They can also leverage 100+ Data Prep operators to enrich the Analytics data during ingestion into Adobe Experience Platform (AEP). RTCDP Customers can now enable multiple Data Prep-enabled report suites for Profile.<p>CJA customers who ingest multiple report suites via the Analytics Source Connector now have a means to deconflict column differences between report suites. For example, if "Search Term" is stored in `eVar1` in one report suite and in `eVar2` in another report suite, using Data Prep you can extend the Analytics field group with a new column that merges the values from the two eVars. | April 27, 2022 |

|[!UICONTROL Persistence] options for binding dimensions and binding metrics| When creating or editing a data view, you can bind the persistence of a dimension to another dimension or metric. This concept is known as _merchandising_ in Adobe Analytics, and is now supported in CJA.

| [!UICONTROL First Known] and [!UICONTROL Last Known] allocation models | These two new allocation models take the first or last observed value for a dimension within a specified persistence scope (session, person, or custom time period with look-back.) Then they apply the allocation model to all events within the specified scope. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/component-settings/persistence.html#allocation-settings)| January 19, 2022 |
| [!UICONTROL PersonID] and [!UICONTROL PersonID namespace] as dimensions | Exposes the `personID` (or `customerID`, or whatever ID you are using for merging data sets in a connection) as a dimension in data views. This enhancement makes it easier for you to include the `personID` as a dimension in your data view by pulling it in from the connection.
