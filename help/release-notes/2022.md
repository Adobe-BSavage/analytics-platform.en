# 2022 Customer Journey Analytics release notes

## March 2022 {#mar22}

| Feature | Description | [Targeted Date](/help/release-notes/releases.md) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Annotations in Workspace | Annotations in Workspace enable you to effectively communicate contextual data nuances and insights to your organization. [Learn more](/help/components/annotations/overview.md) | Gradual rollout starts March 23, 2022 |
| New Customer Journey Analytics landing page | The landing page for Customer Journey Analytics features a project manager home page and a learning section to help you with getting started more effectively. [Learn more](/help/getting-started/landing.md)| April 1, 2022 |
|  [!UICONTROL Next item] or [!UICONTROL Previous item] Workspace panel | The [!UICONTROL Next or Previous item] panel allows you to explore items that follow or precede a dimension item of your choice. For example, use it if you want to see the next or previous pages to a specific product page, or marketing channel, or even device type. This panel goes beyond legacy next/previous reporting because it allows you to look at any dimension and does not require any new implementation to get insights. | April 20, 2022 |

| Mobile scorecard project preview mode | Launch a preview of how your mobile scorecard will look in the Analytics dashboards app, directly from the scorecard builder. The preview mode allows users to interact with filters and charts in the same way they would in the app, allowing them to preview the experience before they save and share the scorecard. Users can also use the device picker in preview mode to see how their scorecard will look on different devices.

## January 2022 {#jan2022}

| Feature | Description | Targeted Date |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
|[!UICONTROL Persistence] options for binding dimensions and binding metrics| When creating or editing a data view, you can bind the persistence of a dimension to another dimension or metric. This concept is known as _merchandising_ in Adobe Analytics, and is now supported in CJA. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/component-settings/persistence.html#binding-dimension) and [use case](/help/use-cases/binding-dimensions-metrics.md)| January 19, 2022 |
| [!UICONTROL First Known] and [!UICONTROL Last Known] allocation models | These two new allocation models take the first or last observed value for a dimension within a specified persistence scope (session, person, or custom time period with look-back.) Then they apply the allocation model to all events within the specified scope. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/component-settings/persistence.html#allocation-settings)| January 19, 2022 |
| [!UICONTROL PersonID] and [!UICONTROL PersonID namespace] as dimensions | Exposes the `personID` (or `customerID`, or whatever ID you are using for merging data sets in a connection) as a dimension in data views. This enhancement makes it easier for you to include the `personID` as a dimension in your data view by pulling it in from the connection.
