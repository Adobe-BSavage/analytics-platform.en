## Table Functions versus Row Functions 

A table function is one where the output is the same for every row of the table. A row function is one where the output is different for every row of the table.

## What does the Include-Zeros parameter mean?

It tells whether to include zeros in the computation. Sometimes zero means "nothing", but sometimes it's important.

For example, if you have a Revenue metric, and then add a Page Views metric to the report, there are suddenly more rows for your revenue which are all zero. You probably don't want this to affect any MEAN, MIN, QUARTILE, etc. calculations that you have on the revenue column. In this case, you would check the include-zeros parameter.

On the other hand, if you have two metrics that you are interested in, it may not be fair to say that one has a higher average or minimum because some of its rows were zeros, so you would not check the parameter to include the zeros.

```
PERCENTILE(metric,k)
```

<table id="table_35CD840ACFB44CD9979881DB8823CC53"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Argument </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Description </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <i>metric</i> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> The metric column that defines relative standing. </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>k </p> </td>

```
QUARTILE(metric,quart)
```

<table id="table_64EA3DAAE77541439D59FAF0353F83A2"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Argument </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Description </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <i>metric</i> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> The metric for which you want the quartile value. </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>quart </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> Indicates which *value to return. </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

&#42;If *quart* = 0, QUARTILE returns the minimum value. If *quart* = 1, QUARTILE returns the first quartile (25 percentile). If *quart* = 2, QUARTILE returns the first quartile (50 percentile). If *quart* = 3, QUARTILE returns the first quartile (75 percentile). If *quart* = 4, QUARTILE returns the maximum value.

## Round 

Returns the nearest integer for a given value. For example, if you want to avoid reporting currency decimals for revenue and a product has $569.34, use the formula Round( *Revenue*) to round revenue to the nearest dollar, or $569. A product reporting $569.51 will be round to the nearest dollar, or $570.

```
ROUND(metric)
```

|  Argument  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  *number* | The metric you want to round.  |

Round without a digits parameter is the same as round with a digits parameter of 0, namely round to the nearest integer. With a digits parameter it returns that many digits to the right of the decimal. If digits is negative, it returns 0's to the left of the decimal.

```
round( 314.15, 0) = 314 
round( 314.15, 1) = 314.1 
round( 314.15, -1) = 310 
round( 314.15, -2) = 300
```

## Row Count

## Row Max 

The maximum of the columns in each row.

## Row Min 

The minimum of the columns in each row.

## Row Sum

```

|  Argument  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  *number* | The metric for which you want the square root.  |

## Standard Deviation (Table) 

Returns the standard deviation, or square root of the variance, based on a sample population of data.

The equation for STDEV is:

![](assets/std_dev.png)

where x is the sample mean (*metric*) and *n* is the sample size.

```
STDEV(metric)
```

<table id="table_8BCF2E4B02434AABAAD026FB3C4E8B2F"> 
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <b> Argument</b> </td> 
   <td> <b> Description</b> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td> <b> <i> metric</i> </b> </td> 
   <td> <p> The metric for which you want for standard deviation. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

## Variance (Table) 

Returns the variance based on a sample population of data.

The equation for VARIANCE is:

![](assets/variance_eq.png)

where x is the sample mean, MEAN(*metric*), and *n* is the sample size.

```
VARIANCE(metric)
```

|  Argument  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  *metric* | The metric for which you want the variance.  |

In order to calculate a variance you look at an entire column of numbers. From that list of numbers you first calculate the average. Once you have the average you go through each entry and do the following:

1. Subtract the average from the number.

2. Square the result.

3. Add that to the total.

Once you have iterated over the entire column you have a single total. You then divide that total by the number of items in the column. That number is the variance for the column. It is a single number. It is, however, displayed as a column of numbers.

As an example, let's say you have a three-item column:

1

2

3

The average of this column is 2. The variance for the column will be ((1 - 2)<sup>2</sup> + (2 - 2)<sup>2</sup> + (3 - 2)<sup>2</sup>/3 = 2/3.

>
>0 (zero) means False, and any other value is True.

```
AND(logical_test1,[logical_test2],...)

|---|---|
|  *logical_test1* | Required. Any value or expression that can be evaluated to TRUE or FALSE.  |
|  *logical_test2* | Optional. Additional conditions that you want to evaluate as TRUE or FALSE  |

## Approximate Count Distinct (dimension)

Returns the approximated distinct count of dimension items for the selected dimension. The function uses the HyperLogLog (HLL) method of approximating distinct counts.&nbsp; It is configured to guarantee the value is within 5% of the actual value 95% of the time.

```
Approximate Count Distinct (dimension)
```

|  Argument  |  |
|---|---|
|  *dimension* | The dimension for which you want the approximate distinct item count.  |

### Example Use Case

Approximate Count Distinct (customer ID eVar) is a common use case for this function.

Definition for a new 'Approximate Customers' calculated metric:

![Approximate county distinct new dimension definition showing Customer ID (eVar1)](assets/approx-count-distinct.png)

This is how the "Approximate Customers" metric could be used in reporting:

![Freeform Table showing Unique Visitors and Approximate Customers ](assets/approx-customers.png)

### Comparing Count Functions

Approximate Count Distinct() is an improvement over Count() and RowCount() functions because the metric created can be used in any dimensional report to render an approximated count of items for a separate dimension. For example, a count of customer IDs used in a Mobile Device Type report.

This function will be marginally less accurate than Count() and RowCount() because it uses the HLL method, whereas Count() and RowCount() are exact counts.

## T-Score

Alias for Z-Score, namely the deviation from the mean divided by the standard deviation

## T-Test

Performs an m-tailed t-test with t-score of col and n degrees of freedom.

The signature is `t_test( x, n, m )`. Underneath, it simply calls `m*cdf_t(-abs(x),n)`. (This is similar to the z-test function which runs `m*cdf_z(-abs(x))`.

Here, `m` is the number of tails, and `n` is the degrees of freedom. These should be numbers (constant for the whole report, i.e. not changing on a row by row basis).

`X` is the t-test statistic, and would often be a formula (e.g. zscore) based on a metric and will be evaluated on every row.

The return value is the probability of seeing the test statistic x given the degrees of freedom and number of tails.

**Examples:**

1. Use it to find outliers:

   ```
   t_test( zscore(bouncerate), row-count-1, 2)
   ```

1. Combine it with `if` to ignore very high or low bounce rates, and count visits on everything else:

   ```
   if ( t_test( z-score(bouncerate), row-count, 2) < 0.01, 0, visits )
   ```

## Tangent

Returns the tangent of the given angle. If the angle is in degrees, multiply the angle by PI( )/180.

```
TAN (metric)
```

|  Argument  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  *metric* | The angle in radians for which you want the tangent.  |

## Z-Score (Row)

Returns the Z-score, or normal score, based upon a normal distribution. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations an observation is from the mean. A Z-score of 0 (zero) means the score is the same as the mean. A Z-score can be positive or negative, indicating whether it is above or below the mean and by how many standard deviations.

The equation for Z-score is:

![](assets/z_score.png)

where [!DNL x] is the raw score, [!DNL μ] is the mean of the population, and [!DNL σ] is the standard deviation of the population.

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL μ] (mu) and[!DNL σ] (sigma) are automatically calculated from the metric.
