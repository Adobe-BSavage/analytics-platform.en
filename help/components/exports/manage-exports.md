After you export a full table as described in [Export Customer Journey Analytics data to the cloud](/help/analysis-workspace/export/export-cloud.md), the exports are available on the [!UICONTROL Exports] tab on the [!UICONTROL Exports] page. 

## Manage exports

You can edit, re-export, duplicate, tag, or delete existing exports:

1. In Customer Journey Analytics, select [!UICONTROL **Components**] > [!UICONTROL **Exports**].

1. On the [!UICONTROL **Exports**] tab, select one or more existing exports.

1. Select one of the following options:

   |Option | Function | 
   |---------|----------|
   | [!UICONTROL **Edit**] | Allows you to edit the selected export, including the export's properties, format, scheduling, and location information. </br>This option is not available when selecting multiple exports. | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Export now**] | Runs the selected export using the most recent Customer Journey Analytics data. This is useful if you want to re-export data that you previously exported ad hoc, or if you set up an export to run on a schedule and you want to run the export before the next scheduled export. </br>This option is not available when selecting multiple exports. | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Duplicate**] | Duplicates the selected export. </br>This option is not available when selecting multiple exports. | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Tag**] |  |  
   | [!UICONTROL **Delete**] | Deletes the selected exports. | 

## Configure columns

You can configure what information is displayed for each export on the Exports page by adding or removing columns.
