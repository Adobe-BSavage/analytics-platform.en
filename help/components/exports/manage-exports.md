After you export a full table as described in [Export Customer Journey Analytics data to the cloud](/help/analysis-workspace/export/export-cloud.md), the exports are available on the [!UICONTROL Exports] tab on the [!UICONTROL Exports] page. 

You can edit, re-export, duplicate, tag, or delete existing exports:

1. In Customer Journey Analytics, select [!UICONTROL **Components**] > [!UICONTROL **Exports**].

1. On the [!UICONTROL **Exports**] tab, select one or more existing exports.

   |Option | Function |

   | [!UICONTROL **Export now**] | Runs the selected export using the most recent Customer Journey Analytics data.
