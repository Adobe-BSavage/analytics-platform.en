# Date ranges overview

Date ranges are a type of component you can use in Workspace projects. They allow you to see data trended over time or see when events happen the most. Date ranges are color-coded purple.

Custom date ranges allow you to customize the dates you see in Workspace projects. Use the Date range manager to [manage](manage.md) or [create](create.md) custom date ranges.
