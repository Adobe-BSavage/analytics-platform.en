# Manage filters

The Filter Manager offers many ways of curating segments, such as sharing, tagging, approving, copying, deleting, and marking as favorites.

The Filter Manager shows you all the filters you own and that have been shared with you. Admin-level users can see all filters in the organization. This overview presents the user interface and the capabilities of the Filter Manager. 

Access the Filter Manager by

* Going to **[!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analysis]** > **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Filters]** in the top navigation.
* Displaying an existing project and clicking the Filter icon  ![](assets/segment_icon.png) in the left navigation. Then click **[!UICONTROL Manage]**.
