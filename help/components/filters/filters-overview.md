# Filters overview

Customer Journey Analytics lets you build, manage, share, and apply powerful, focused audience filters to your reports.
Filtering capabilities includes the Filter Builder to construct filters and run a pre-test, and the Filter Manager to collect, tag, approve, set security, and share filters across your organization. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
Filters are known as 'segments' in Adobe Analytics.
