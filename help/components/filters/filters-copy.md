# Copy filters

When creating a new filter, it's sometimes easier to copy an existing filter that is close to the filter that you want to create, then modify the version you copied.

To copy a filter in the Filter manager:

1. In Customer Journey Analytics, select the **[!UICONTROL Components]** tab, then select **[!UICONTROL Filter]**. 

1. In the Filter manager, select the filter that you want to copy. 

   The filter management tool bar appears.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Copy]**.
