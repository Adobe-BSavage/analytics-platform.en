   ![Tag Filters dialog](assets/tag-filter-dialog.png)

   1. (optionally) use ![Search](/help/assets/icons/Search.svg) to search for and limit the list of tags.

   2. Based on the list of tags:
   
      * select one or more existing tags from the list, or
      * enter a new tag and press **[!UICONTROL ENTER]**. Repeat to add more than one new tag.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the tags for the filter. Select **[!UICONTROL Cancel]** to cancel.

You can sort your list of filters by favorites. Select **[!UICONTROL Other filters]** from the ![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) **[!UICONTROL Filter]** panel and select **[!UICONTROL Favorites]**. See [Filter the list of filters](/help/components/filters/filters-filter.md) for more information.

Within the Filter Manager, you can set up a workflow that includes approving filter for various levels of application, for specific departments or groups, and consistent with reporting policies.

Here is how to flag a filter as approved:

1. In Filter Manager, check the checkbox to the left of the Filter title.
    
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Approve]** in the filter management task bar.

1. Consider sharing the approved filter/s with your organization.
    
1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

    Notice the approval icon next to the filter in the list:
