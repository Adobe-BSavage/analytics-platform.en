# Manage audiences created in Customer Journey Analytics

>[!NOTE]
>
>This functionality is currently in [limited testing](/help/release-notes/releases.md).

Managing previously created audiences lets you

* **Schedule or de-schedule** automatic audience refresh/update. The maximum expiration on the schedule is 1 year. 
* **Renew an audience refreshing schedule** when it is about to expire. Expiring audiences are treated similarly to expiring scheduled reports - the admin gets an email a month before the schedule expires.
* View the the **refresh interval** and the **last time an Audience was updated**
* Gain insight into the **amount of time it took to produce an audience** from Customer Journey Analytics (CJA), and the amount of time it took to have the audience appear in Real-time Customer Profile for activation purposes.
* See whether the audiences in CJA are **being actively used by Real-time Customer Profile** or (ideally) any Experience Platform applications that consume the audiences created by CJA.
