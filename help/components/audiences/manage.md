# Manage audiences created in Customer Journey Analytics

Managing audiences that were previously created lets you

* **Schedule or de-schedule** automatic Audience refresh/update. The maximum expiration on the schedule is 1 year. 
* **Renew an audience refreshing schedule** when it is about to expire. Expiring Audiences are treated similarly to expiring scheduled reports - the admin gets an email a month before the schedule expires.
* **View the last time an Audience was updated**
* Gain insight into the **amount of time it took to produce an audience** from Customer Journey Analytics (CJA), and the amount of time it took to have the audience appear in Unified Profile for activation purposes
* See whether the audiences in CJA are **being actively used by Real-time Customer Profile** or (ideally) any Experience Platform applications that consume the audiences created by CJA.

## Management UI





## View and use CJA audiences in Experience Platform

You can view CJA audiences in Platform by going to [!UICONTROL Segments] > [!UICONTROL Create segments] > [!UICONTROL Audiences] tab > [!UICONTROL CJA Audiences].
