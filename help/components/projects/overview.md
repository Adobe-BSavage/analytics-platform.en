# Projects overview

Projects are the overarching "file" used in Analysis Workspace. They contain one or more panels, which let you organize visualizations.

Use the Project manager to [manage](manage.md) or [create](create.md) Workspace projects. If you want to learn more about using projects in Analysis Workspace, see [Workspace basics](../../projects/workspace-basics.md).
