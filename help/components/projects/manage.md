![UI](../assets/project-ui.png)

The project manager includes the following options:

* **Add**: Create a new project. See [create a project](create.md) for more information.
* **Search by title**: Search for a project by title. Results are filtered based on text entered here.
* **Filter**: Filter projects using the left column. You can filter by custom tag, owner, created by you, your favorites, approved, or shared with you. You can also search for desired filters.
* **Favorite**: Click the ![star](../assets/star.png) icon next to a project to add it to your favorites.
* **Customize columns**: Click the ![columns](../assets/columns.png) icon to show or hide columns in the project manager.

Click the checkbox next to one or more projects for more options.

* **Tag**: Apply a tag to all selected projects. Tags help you organize projects, and let you filter them using the left column.
* **Share**: Share a project to other Experience Cloud users. If you are a product administrator, you can also share to the entire organization or groups. Projects that are shared to other users in your organization include a ![shared](../assets/shared.png) icon next to the title.
* **Delete**: Permanently delete the selected project(s).
* **Rename**: If a single project is selected, you can change its title.
* **Approve**: If you are a product admin, you can add a stamp of approval to a project. Approved projects inform users in your organization that they are 'official', differentiating them from projects created by other users in your organization. Approved projects include a ![approved](../assets/approved.png) icon next to the title.
* **Unapprove**: If you are a product admin and select a project that is already approved, you can unapprove it.
* **Copy**: Create a copy of the selected project(s). Copying projects appends `(Copy)` to the end of the title of the newly copied project(s).
* **Export to CSV**: Exports all selected projects into a CSV file. Columns in the resulting CSV file include all visible columns in the project manager.
