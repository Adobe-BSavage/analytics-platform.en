# Create a project

There are two methods to [create a project](/help/analysis-workspace/home.md) in Analysis Workspace:

* Click [!UICONTROL Projects] in the header, then click [!UICONTROL Create New Project].
* Click [!UICONTROL Components] > [!UICONTROL Projects], then click ![Add](../assets/add.png) [!UICONTROL Add].

Creating a project presents you with a blank Workspace project:

<!-- This page serves as a placeholder for the 'Create project' modal that is currently in the old world. -->
