# [!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics] overview
 
[!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics] is a groundbreaking new Analytics capability that integrates the flexibility and power of Analysis Workspace with the Experience Cloud Platform (ECP) and its data channels and sources. By now, you are familiar with Analysis Workspace, which allows reporting and exploration at the "speed of thought." Its ability to break down, filter, query, and visualize years' worth of data, often in seconds, is now being combined with the ECP's ability to hold all of your data with all kinds of schemas and types, coming from unique channels and sources. Using the **Experience Data Format (XDM)** (link) allows data to be uniformly represented and organized, ready for combination and exploration. **Experience Query Services (EQS)** allows you to use SQL-compatible tools and frameworks to query and manipulate all your data.

[!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics] lets you:


* **See the customer in a journey context.** You can view and analyze data sequentially, spanning multiple channels such as call center, POS systems, and online properties and combine them into a single reporting view (Data Group).
* **Make insights available to everyone.** Democratize data access and let more people make business decisions with data-derived insights.
* **Harness the power of data science for your analysts.** [!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics] lets normal humans use data science to unlock deep insights and analysis.
* **Visualize and interact with your datasets using ad-hoc reporting.** Workspace can import any Datasets in Platform that conform to some basic rules.
* **View non-web data.** Because Dataset schemas can be custom, Workspace is no longer limited to a rigid definition of what a "hit" or event must be. Evars, props, uniques exceeded, and other Adobe Analytics limitations no longer apply.
* **Exert greater control over your data manipulation.** Because ECP provides basic querying and ETL tools via Experience Cloud Query Service (EQS), you can now change data you've uploaded, create new Datasets, and then import them into Workspace.
