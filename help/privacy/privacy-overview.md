# [!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics] privacy overview

Generally speaking, any privacy-related settings in [!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics] are inherited from Adobe Experience Platform.

## GDPR

[!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics] (CJA) will not subscribe to the GDPR Central Service directly and will instead inherit all dataset changes made in Experience Platform. We depend on Platform Data Lake to enforce GDPR deletion requests and notify us when theyâ€™ve been completed on Pipeline. We listen to Pipeline and synchronize all changes to affected batches in CJA for event datasets. Profile and lookup datasets affected by GDPR deletion requests will be completely re-ingested after each delete request. We can guarantee deletion requests are executed within 7 days of a deletion event in Data Lake.

## CCPA
