# Audit logs

To increase the transparency and visibility of activities performed in the system, Customer Journey Analytics allows you to audit user activity for various services and capabilities in the form of "audit logs". These logs form an audit trail that can help with troubleshooting issues, and help your business effectively comply with corporate data stewardship policies and regulatory requirements, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

In a basic sense, an audit log tells **who** performed **what** action, and **when**. Each action recorded in a log contains metadata that indicates the action type, date and time, the email ID of the user who performed the action, and additional attributes relevant to the action type.

This document covers audit logs in CJA, including how to view and manage them in the UI.
