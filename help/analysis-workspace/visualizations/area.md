# Area and area stacked

## Area

The ![GraphArea](/help/assets/icons/GraphArea.svg) [!UICONTROL Area] visualization is like a line graph, but with a colored area below the line. Add an  area graph when you have multiple metrics and want to visualize the area expressed by the intersection of two or more metrics.

## Area stacked

This ![GraphAreaStacked](/help/assets/icons/GraphAreaStacked.svg) [!UICONTROL Area stacked] visualization is like an Area, but each series begins at the top of the previous series.

Use the **[!UICONTROL 100% stacked]** option in ![Setting](/help/assets/icons/Setting.svg) **[!UICONTROL Settings]** to turn the chart into a 100% stacked visualization.
