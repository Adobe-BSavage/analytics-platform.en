# Journey canvas

Journey canvas visualizations in Customer Journey Analytics are flexible journeys that allow you to analyze the fallthrough and fallout of a user journey. 

You can create journeys in Customer Journey Analytics, or you can enhance journeys that were created in Adobe Journey Optimizer. 

Journeys can contain multiple entry points, events, conditions, and paths.
