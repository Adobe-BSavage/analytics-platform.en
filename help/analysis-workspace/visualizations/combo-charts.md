# Combo chart

The [!UICONTROL Combo chart] visualization makes it easy to quickly build a comparison visualization without having to build a table first. You can easily view trends in your data in a line/bar combination.

Use a [!UICONTROL Combo chart] to:

* Compare this week's orders to orders at the same time last month (and last year) - all within a few clicks.
* Quickly analyze and compare multiple metrics (like [!UICONTROL Unique Visitors] and [!UICONTROL Revenue]) against one another on the same chart.
* Analyze a metric against a function (such as [!UICONTROL Cumulative Average]) over a time horizon.

Keep this in mind:

* You can add multiple comparisons in a single [!UICONTROL Combo chart].
* If you add one or more comparisons, they have to be of the same type, such as [!UICONTROL Time comparison].
* You can add up to 5 comparisons.
* You can apply up to 3 filters to a metric.
* Calculated metrics are not supported in Combo charts.

## Build a Combo chart

1. Add a combo chart. See [Add a visualization to a panel](freeform-analysis-visualizations.md#add-visualizations-to-a-panel)

1. From the drop-down lists, select a dimension for the X-axis and a metric for the Y-axis.

1. Select the type of [!UICONTROL Line comparison] you want to use.

   | Line comparison type | Definition |
   | --- | --- |
   | **[!UICONTROL Time comparison]** | The most common type of comparison - comparing this time period to 4 weeks ago, for example. If you selected [!UICONTROL Time comparison], make a secondary selection as to which time period you want to compare.<p>![LIne comparison with Time period selected and the secondary selection field for Time period.](assets/combo-time-period.png) |
   | **[!UICONTROL Function]** | You could introduce a function like [!UICONTROL Average] into the comparison. See a list of supported functions below.<p>![LIne comparison drop-down menu showing Functions selected and a list of available supported functions.](assets/combo-functions.png) |
   | **[!UICONTROL Secondary metric]** | You could, for example, compare [!UICONTROL Revenue] to another metric.<p>![A Combo chart comparing two metrics.](assets/combo-2metrics-settings.png) |

   {style="table-layout:auto"}

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Build]**.

   The output will look similar to this:

   ![A Combo chart showing the current period in a bar chart and comparison period in the line chart ](assets/combo-output.png)

   The current period is shown in the bar chart, and the comparison period is represented by the line chart. The dots on the line chart are known as "bar bells".

## Supported functions

If you choose **[!UICONTROL Function]** as the [!UICONTROL Line comparison type], a function of the metric you have chosen will be returned.

| Function | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **[!UICONTROL Column Sum]** | Adds all of the numeric values for a metric within a column (across the elements of a dimension) |
| **[!UICONTROL Cumulative Average]** | Returns the average of the last N rows. |
| **[!UICONTROL Median]** | Returns the median for a metric in a column. The median is the number in the middle of a set of numbersâ€”that is, half the numbers have values that are greater than or equal to the median, and half are less than or equal to the median. |
| **[!UICONTROL Cumulative]** | The cumulative sum of N rows.  |
| **[!UICONTROL Column Maximum]** | Returns the largest value in a set of dimension elements for a metric column. |
| **[!UICONTROL Mean]** | Returns the arithmetic mean, or average, for a metric. |
| **[!UICONTROL Column Minimum]** | Returns the smallest value in a set of dimension elements for a metric column. |

Here is an example of the cumulative average of the Revenue metric:

Here is an example of a combo chart with both Cumulative average and Mean functions:
