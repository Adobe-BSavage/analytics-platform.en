# Flow

The ![GraphPathing](/help/assets/icons/GraphPathing.svg) [!UICONTROL Flow] visualization shows customer paths through your websites and apps.

With the visualization you can:

* Visualize the customer journey through your website or application.
* Analyze where customers go before and after specified checkpoints, such as entry, a specific dimension, or exit.
* Create filters by designating a specific point in a chosen path

## Inter-dimensional flows

You can show the [flow between dimensions](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/c-flow/multi-dimensional-flow.md). For example, you might combine pages and departments in one diagram. In this case, your flow might go from the home page, to the Men page, then to the Shoes department.

Each column could show a different dimension. Drag a dimension and drop in a drop zone to add that dimension to the diagram.
