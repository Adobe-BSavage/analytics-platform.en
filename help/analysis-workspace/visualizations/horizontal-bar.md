# Horizontal Bar and Horizontal Bar Stacked

## Horizontal Bar

This visualization shows horizontal bars representing various values across one or more metrics.

## Horizontal Bar Stacked

This visualization is like the [!UICONTROL Horizontal Bar Chart], but the series bars appear stacked.

Use the **[!UICONTROL 100% stacked]** option in ![Setting](/help/assets/icons/Setting.svg) **[!UICONTROL Settings]** to turn the chart into a 100% stacked visualization.
