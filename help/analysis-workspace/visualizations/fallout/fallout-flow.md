Fallout visualizations provide more options to build your fallout reports. Fallout visualizations let you:

* Perform side-by-side comparisons of two different filters in the same report.
* Drag and drop (and rearrange) funnel steps (touchpoints).
* Mix and match values from different dimensions and metrics.
* Create a multi-dimensional fallout report. 
* Identify where customers go immediately after falling out.

Fallout displays conversion and fallout rates between each step or touchpoint in a sequence.

For example, you can track a person's fallout points during a purchase process. Just select a beginning touchpoint and a conclusion touchpoint, and add intermediate touchpoints to create a website navigation path. But you can also do multi-dimensional fallouts.

A fallout visualization is useful for analyzing:

* Conversion rates through specific processes on your site (such as a purchase or registration process).
* General, wider-scope traffic flows: Of the people who visited the home page, this flow shows how many performed a search. And then how many of them eventually looked at a specific item.
* Correlations between events on your site. Correlations show what percentage of people who looked at your privacy policy went on to purchase a product.
