# Add hyperlinks to dimensions in a freeform table

You can add hyperlinks to dimension items to make them clickable within a freeform table in Analysis Workspace. 

Adding hyperlinks to dimension items can be helpful when the dimension item value contains a URL:

* Add hyperlinks to dimension items that display a URL (for example, a Page URL dimension)

* Add hyperlinks to dimension items that contain breakdowns that displays a URL (for example, a Page Name dimension that has a breakdown of a Page URL dimension)

To add hyperlinks to one or more dimension items:

1. In a freeform table in Analysis Workspace, do any of the following:

   * Right-click a dimension name in the column header.

   * Right-click a single dimension item within the table.

   * Select multiple dimension items within the table (hold the Shift or Ctrl key to select mutliple items), then right-click one of the selected items.

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Create hyperlink**] from the right-click menu.
