## Dimension sorting in Freeform tables

>[!NOTE]
>
>Dimension sorting applies only to Freeform tables in Customer Journey Analytics, not in traditional Adobe Analytics. Metric sorting can be done in both versions of Analytics.

1. In any Freeform table in a project, click the arrow next to the dimension name:

* The down-arrow sorts in descending order and the up-arrow (default) in ascending order.
* You can sort dimensions alphabetically or numerically. For example, you may have numbered steps in a workflow and may want to sort by the step number. You might sort a date-related dimension by date. Or you could sort data sources alphabetically, as in the screenshot above.
