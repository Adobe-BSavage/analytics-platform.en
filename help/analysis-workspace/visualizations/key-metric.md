# Key metric summary

The [!UICONTROL Key metric summary] visualization lets you see how an important metric is trending within a single timeframe. It also lets you compare metric performance across two timeframes. It provides the benefits of multiple visualizations combined into one visualization:

* **[!UICONTROL Line]** visualizations that shows how the metric is trending for the primary and comparison date ranges

* **[!UICONTROL Summary percent change]** that shows the metric increase or decrease between the primary and comparison date ranges

* Current total value ([!UICONTROL **summary number**]) for the metric

## Use cases

This visualization addresses a variety of common use cases, including:

* An analyst trying to understand how opportunity creation looked this month compared to the same timeframe last year. 

* A marketer exploring how lead generation for a specific lead type has changed from this month to last month.

* An executive wanting to understand how new bookings changed from this quarter to last quarter.

## Configure the Key metric summary

1. Drag the **[!UICONTROL Key metric summary]** visualization from the **[!UICONTROL Visualizations]** menu in the left rail into a panel.

1. Configure the visualization by selecting a metric, a primary date range, and a comparison date range and a filter (if desired):

   ![Key metric configuration showing the options for metric, primary date range, comparison date range, and segment.](assets/key-metrics-config.png)

   | Configuration setting | Definition |
   | --- | --- |
   | **[!UICONTROL Metric]** | Select the metric you want to examine. All metrics are supported. |
   | **[!UICONTROL Primary date range]** | The current date range for the freeform table.  |
   | **[!UICONTROL Comparison date range]** | The date range to which you want to compare the primary date range. |
   | **[!UICONTROL Filter (optional)]** | Any filter that you are specifically interested in for this summary.  |

   {style="table-layout:auto"}

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Build]**.

<!--## How the Key Metric Summary visualization handles the comparison date range

(This will probably release in January. Per Jaden Howell)

* If the primary date range is set to the panel date range, there are 2-6 options that are considered 'relative' to the primary date range. These usually include the previous period (same amount of time immediately proceeding the primary date range), and 52 weeks prior to that date range.

* If the comparison date range is set to one of the 'relative' options, upon updating the primary date range, the comparison date range updates to the period immediate preceding the panel date range.

* If your comparison date range is *not* set to a 'relative' option, then updating the panel date range changes your primary date range, but has no effect on the comparison date range.

**Example 1**

Primary date range is set to the panel's date range: 'Yesterday'
Comparison date range is set to a relative date range, one of: 'Previous day', 'Same day last week', 'Same day 4 weeks prior', 'Same day last month', 'Same day last year', or 'Same day 52 weeks prior'.
When I change the panel's date range to 'This month', the comparison date range will update to 'Previous month'.

**Example 2**
 
Primary date range is set to the panel's date range: 'Yesterday'
Comparison date range is set to a non-relative date range, such as 'Feb 2nd, 2022', 'Highest sales day', 'Last week', etc. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Last week is relative to the day the project is opened on, but it is not based on the panel's date range of 'Yesterday'. In other cases, such as if the panel's date range was 'This week', it may be relative.

When you change the panel's date range to '4 days ago', the comparison date range remains at the previous selection. -->

## View the output

The output should look something like this:

![Key metric output showing the metic, summary change, summary number, and line graphs.](assets/key-metrics.png)

Please note:

* The **[!UICONTROL Previous period]** line graph (always displayed in grey) corresponds to the **[!UICONTROL Comparison date range]** in the configuration step.

* If a comparison date range is not specified during configuration or is hidden in the visualization settings, only the line graph for the primary date range is displayed. The summary change will be hidden. 

* From here, you can hover over the line graphs to see the statistics for individual days:


## Visualization settings

The Key metric summary offers multiple flexible settings to enable better reporting and communication of important metrics. Settings can be accessed through ![Setting](/help/assets/icons/Setting.svg) **Settings** in the top right-hand corner of the visualization.  

![Key metric summary settings showing Summary display type, general, and display options.](assets/key-metrics-settings.png){width=60%}

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[!UICONTROL Emphasize percent change]** | Display summary change in prominent bold type in the center of the visualization |
| **[!UICONTROL Emphasize number value]** | Display summary number in prominent bold type in the center of the visualization |
| **[!UICONTROL Legend visible]** | Show or hide the legend at the bottom of the visualization |
| **[!UICONTROL Show annotations]** | Show or hide annotations added by an admin |
| **[!UICONTROL Show sparklines]** | Show or hide line charts at the bottom of the chart. When hidden, the legend will change to no longer visually reference the lines |
| **[!UICONTROL Show min and max on sparklines]** | Show or hide minimum and maximum values on primary and comparison line charts |
| **[!UICONTROL Show comparison]** | Show or hide comparison data. When hidden, both the comparison line chart and summary change objects will be hidden from view. |
| **[!UICONTROL Show total number]** | Show or hide summary number |
| **[!UICONTROL Show raw difference]** | Show or hide raw difference between the total value of the metric in the primary date range and the secondary date range |
| **[!UICONTROL Abbreviate value]** | Abbreviate number values to simplify communicated insights (e.g. 20,000 -> 20K) |

## Edit visualization

After building the visualization, you can still edit the original configuration. 

1. Click ![Edit](/help/assets/icons/Edit.svg) in the top right corner of the visualization (next to ![Setting](/help/assets/icons/Setting.svg)).

   You are now taken back to the original configuration view. 

1. Change the metric, primary date range, comparison date range, or filter as preferred.
