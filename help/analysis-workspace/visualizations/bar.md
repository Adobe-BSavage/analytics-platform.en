# Bar and bar stacked

## Bar

The ![GraphBarVertical](/help/assets/icons/GraphBarVertical.svg) bar visualization shows vertical bars representing various values across one or more metrics.

A granularity drop-down in the visualization settings lets you change a trended visualization (for example, line, bar) from daily to weekly to monthly, etc.

## Bar stacked

The ![GraphBarVerticalStacked](/help/assets/icons/GraphBarVerticalStacked.svg) visualization is like a bar chart, but with the series bars stacked on top of each other.

Use the **[!UICONTROL 100% stacked]** option in ![Setting](/help/assets/icons/Setting.svg) **[!UICONTROL Settings]** to turn the chart into a 100% stacked visualization.
