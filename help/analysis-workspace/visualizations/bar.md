## Bar 

This visualization shows vertical bars representing various values across one or more metrics.

A granularity drop-down in the visualization settings lets you change a trended visualization (e.g. line, bar) from daily to weekly to monthly, etc.

## Bar stacked 

This visualization is like a bar chart, but with the series bars stacked on top of each other.
