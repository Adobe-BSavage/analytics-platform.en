# Intelligent Alerts - use cases

You can create intelligent alerts as described in [Create alerts](/help/analysis-workspace/c-intelligent-alerts/alert-builder.md).

## Consolidate (stack) alerts instead of creating multiple alerts {#section_B27B0856BA104B9FB6D0BBB317633F18}

Stacking alerts ensures that alerts get combined and you don't get a number of separate alerts.
