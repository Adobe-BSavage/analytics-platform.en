# Experimentation panel

>[!NOTE]
>
>This functionality is currently in [limited testing](/help/release-notes/releases.md).

The **[!UICONTROL Experimentation]** panel lets you evaluate the lift and confidence of any A/B experiment from any experimentation platform - online, offline, from Adobe solutions, Adobe Journey Optimizer, and even BYO (bring-your-own) data. The data has to conform to certain specifications (explained below) and has to be brought into CJA via a connection to an Adobe Experience Platform dataset.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>At this point, [Adobe Analytics for Target](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/integrate/a4t/a4t.html) (A4T) data cannot be evaluated in the [!UICONTROL Experimentation] panel.

## Access Control
