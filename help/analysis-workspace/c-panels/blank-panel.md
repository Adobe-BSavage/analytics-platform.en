A blank panel shows all the visualizations you can use within a panel, and the options to modify the panel, to build a completely customized analysis.

Simply select a visualization (like **[!UICONTROL Cohort table]**) to add to the panel, or select a panel option (like **[!UICONTROL Attribution]**) to modify the panel for a specific purpose.

* Select ![AddCircle](/help/assets/icons/AddCircle.svg) **outside** the panel to add another blank panel.
