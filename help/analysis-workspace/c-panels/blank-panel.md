# Blank panel

A blank panel shows shows a selection of panels (indicated by ![WebPage](/help/assets/icons/WebPage.svg)) or visualizations that you can create to build a completely customized analysis. 

When you select a panel, the blank panel transitions to the selected panel. When you select a visualization, the visualization is added to the blank panel. For example, select a visualization (like ![ViewList](/help/assets/icons/ViewList.svg) **[!UICONTROL Cohort table]**) to add to the panel, or select a panel (like ![WebPage](/help/assets/icons/WebPage.svg) **[!UICONTROL Attribution]**) to modify the panel for a specific purpose.

* Select ![AddCircle](/help/assets/icons/AddCircle.svg) **outside** a panel to add another blank panel.
