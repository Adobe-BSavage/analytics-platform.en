# Analysis Workspace overview

Analysis Workspace is a flexible browser tool that allows you to quickly build analyses and share insights. Using the drag-and-drop interface, you can craft your analysis, add visualizations to bring data to life, curate a dataset, share and schedule projects with anyone in your organization.

If you have only a few minutes, watch this brief overview to see what is possible.

## Create a new project {#new-project}

After completing the tutorial, you are ready to begin building your first project. On the [!UICONTROL Projects] tab, you can choose to start from

* [!UICONTROL Blank project] if you plan to share your analysis from the browser, or 
* [[!UICONTROL Blank mobile scorecard]](/help/mobile-app/curator.md), if you plan to share your analysis from the Customer Journey Analytics dashboards mobile app.

## Build your analysis {#analysis}

In your Workspace project, **panels, tables, visualizations, and components** are accessed from the left rail. These are your project building blocks.

### Components

**Components** are dimensions, metrics, filters, or date ranges, all of which can be combined in a **[!UICONTROL Freeform table]** to start answering your business question. Be sure to familiarize yourself with each [component type](/help/components/overview.md) before diving into your analysis. Once you've mastered component terminology, you can begin dragging and dropping to [build your analysis](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md) in a **[!UICONTROL Freeform table]**.

### Visualizations

**Visualizations**, such as a bar or line chart, are then added on top of the data to visually bring it to life. On the far left rail, select the middle **[!UICONTROL Visualizations]** icon to see the full list of [visualizations](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md) available.

Many of the panels provided in Analysis Workspace generate a full set of analyses based on a few user inputs.
