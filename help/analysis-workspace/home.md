# Analysis Workspace overview {#analysis-workspace-overview}

Analysis Workspace allows you to build analyses quickly to gather insights and then share those insights with others. Using the drag-and-drop browser interface, you can craft your analysis, add visualizations to bring data to life, curate a dataset, and share and schedule projects with anyone you choose.

## Interface

The following image and accompanying table explain the main elements in the Analysis Workspace user interface:

![Analysis Workspace window highlighting the far left and left panel, the canvas, and data view dropp-down menu.](assets/analysis-workspace-overview.png)

| Location | Name and function |
|:---------:|----------|
| üÖê | Contains the name of the project, a menu structure to access functionality, a button ![ChevronLeft](/help/assets/icons/ChevronLeft.svg) to return back to your Project list, and a **[!UICONTROL Share]** button to share your Workspace project. <br/>Select the name of your project (for example: Example Project) at any time to change the name. <br/>Select ![StarOutline](/help/assets/icons/StarOutline.svg) to add your project as a favorite project ![Star](/help/assets/icons/Star.svg). |
| üÖë | **Button panel:** Contains buttons for accessing the key [features](#features) of Analysis Workspace: ![WebPage](/help/assets/icons/WebPage.svg) **[!UICONTROL Panels]**, ![GraphBarVertical](/help/assets/icons/GraphBarVertical.svg) **[!UICONTROL Visualizations]**, and ![Curate](/help/assets/icons/Curate.svg) **[!UICONTROL Components]** to your project in Analysis Workspace. The panel also contains a ![ViewList](/help/assets/icons/ViewList.svg) **[!UICONTROL Table of contents]** and ![Bookmark](/help/assets/icons/Bookmark.svg) **[!UICONTROL Data Dictionary]** button to open the Data dictionary. |
| üÖí | **Left panel:** This area contains individual panels, visualizations, components, or lists. The content depends on the button selected in the button panel.  |
| üÖì | **Canvas:** The main area where you drag content from the left panel to build your project. The project dynamically updates as you add panels, add visualizations to panels, and add components to visualizations. You can create multiple panels, and within each panel you can create multiple visualizations.<br/>Each panel is based on a selected data view. The selected data view determines available components like metrics and dimensions. See [Panels - Data view](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md#data-view) for more information. | 

## Features

The key features of Analysis Workspace are available through the button panel:

## Data sources

Synchronizing visualizations lets you control which data table or data source corresponds to a visualization. See [manage data sources](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/t-sync-visualization.md) for more information.

## Use Analysis Workspace


To start using Analysis Workspace: 

1. Log in to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com).
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics]** from the app switcher ![App](/help/assets/icons/Apps.svg) at the top right of the interface.
1. The **[!UICONTROL Projects]** page of Analysis Workspace is shown by default. If a specific project has been selected for you or you have been working on recently, then that project is shown by default.

### Create a project

An analysis in Analysis Workspace is referred to as a [project](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md). 

You can create a project in Analysis Workspace as described in [Create projects](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md).

Projects can be organized into folders and subfolders, as described in [Folders in Analysis Workspace](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/workspace-folders/about-folders.md).

### Save and share a project

As you create an analysis in Analysis Workspace, your work is [automatically saved](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/save-projects.md). 

When you finish building out the project and it's gathering actionable insights, others might want to consume the project. You can share the project with users and groups in your organization, or even with people outside your organization. For information about sharing a project, see [Share projects](/help/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md).
