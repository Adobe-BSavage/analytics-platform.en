# View Density

Adjusting the view density lets you see more data on the screen by reducing the vertical padding of the left rail, freeform tables and cohort tables. Three options are available:

- **[!UICONTROL Compact]**: This is the version with the most condensed view.

- **[!UICONTROL Comfortable]**: This leaves a little more padding than the Compact version.

- **[!UICONTROL Expanded]** (default): This is the view you are used to in Workspace.

To set the view density:
