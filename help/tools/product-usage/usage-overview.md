# Product usage overview

{{release-limited-testing}}

Product usage provides your organization with the ability to view analytics data on how your organization uses Customer Journey Analytics. It is available for all organizations that use Customer Journey Analytics. Once enabled, the following Adobe Experience Platform components are automatically created and hooked up for you:

* A schema in Adobe Experience Platform. This schema is read-only and cannot be edited.
* A dataset in Adobe Experience Platform. The settings for this dataset are read-only and cannot be edited.
* A connection in Customer Journey Analytics. The settings for this connection are read-only and cannot be edited.
* A data view in Customer Journey Analytics. You can edit this data view or create more data views using the same connection.

All data collection and setup is automatically configured for you once enabled. Any time a user makes an action in Analysis Workspace, that action is tracked and available for reporting.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>This feature counts toward your contractual data limits in Adobe Experience Platform. Make sure that your organization can accommodate the data generated by this feature before enabling it.

## Available dimensions

When you enable Product usage, the following dimensions are available:

| Dimension | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Action Name | The type of action that the user took. You can use this dimension as any desired metric by creating a copy in data view settings. |
| Attribution Model Used | The type of attribution model that the current component uses. |
| Component | A derived field. |
| Component Type | The type of component added, removed, or modified. |
| Connection | The connection that the project uses. |
| Data View | The data view that the project uses. |
| Feature | The feature that the project uses. |
| Identifier | The unique identifier for the event. |
| Login User | The user that took the action. |
| Panel Used | The panel where the component was added, removed, or modified. |
| Project | A derived field. |
| Project Name | The friendly name of the project. |
| Project Type | The project type. |
| User ID | The user ID that triggered the event. |
| Visualization Used | The visualization that was added, removed, or modified. | 

Product usage does not track individual project components when a project is merely opened or viewed. The user action of opening a project is tracked, however.
