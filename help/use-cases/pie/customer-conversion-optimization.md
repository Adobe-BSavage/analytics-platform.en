# Customer conversion optimization

Brands often look at the overall conversion rate as a lagging indicator of success and focus on conversion rate optimization to increase the quantity of impressions. But conversion rate is the king of all vanity metrics; it might indicate short-term wins, but by prioritizing quantity over the quality of customer experiences, you risk doing long-term damage to your brand.

## Use case overview

The main goal of the customer conversion optimization use case is to advance a prospect currently in the consideration stage to become a converted customer. To do this, you need to consider each customer's needs to convert, instead of looking only at aggregated conversion rates.

### Out with the old

Many organizations are continuously challenged with understanding macro-level conversion, such as revenue-generating events, hen paired with the contributing factors for any type of conversion event. It can be difficult to micro- and nano-segment customers to launch targeted campaigns for different cohorts to drive registration and conversion.

Typical conversion optimization strategies are also confined to digital channels, such as web or mobile, in isolation. With a lack of knowledge of customer interactions on other touchpoints, brands struggle to plan impactful, multichannel experiences that guide a person from consideration to conversion. As a result they may continue delivering irrelevant or stale messaging, further risking long-term brand damage.

### In with the new

With customer conversion optimization, brands can turn a prospect currently in the consideration stage into a converted customer. Connected conversion optimization tools analyze each prospect's experience on a one-to-one basis and improve their unique experience accordingly. By focusing on each user's journey and honing in on individual
customer success, you can:

* Analyze all the contextual drivers of compelling experiences through both trait and behavioral data to improve conversion events.
* Use advanced segmentation and activation tools for pseudonymous profiles that have not yet registered or converted.
* Scale one-to-one experiences across advertising, social, email, text, and more, using interests and preferred channels to create personalization.
* Use AI modeling to identify indicators and route users down the best path, such as free trials or chat.

Customer conversion optimization is all about balance. Short-term success metrics (like conversion rate) matter, but long-term metrics (like loyalty, lifetime value, brand sentiment, and net promoter score) are what ensure a bright and sustainable future for your brand.

So, instead of attempting to generate the same conversion event from broad segments, focus on building one-to-one customer relationships that last, and analyze the signals and patterns of success. Your conversion rates will naturally improve as a by-product of a customer experience-centric strategy.
