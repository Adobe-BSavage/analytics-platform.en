# Personalized Insights and Enagement Use Cases

Your company may have already spent years perfecting or building your digital transformation initiatives, and that is a great baseline for how your company should evolve to be able to reorient your entire organization in a digital economy. But when you look at how to actually achieve the pinnacle *personalization at scale*, it may appear to require a lot. Achieving personalization at scale requires the ability to have a content supply chain, the ability to have personalized insights and engagement, the ability to have commerce and many other applications powering every touchpoint.

Personalized insights and engagement is the layer that sits in between digital transformation and personalization at scale. But in order to achieve personalization at scale and get the most out of your existing digital transformation efforts, there has to be a foundation that understands and optimizes all of the rich data you have and prepares that data for engagement across holistic customer journeys. Once you have the profile of the whole customer, you can personalize at scale.
