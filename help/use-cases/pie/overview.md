# Personalized Insights and Engagement Use Cases

Your company may have already spent years perfecting or building your digital transformation initiatives. These initiatives are a great baseline for how your company should evolve to be able to reorient your entire organization in a digital economy. But when you look at how to achieve the pinnacle of *personalization at scale*, it may appear to require a lot. Achieving personalization at scale requires the ability to have a content supply chain, the ability to have personalized insights and engagement, the ability to have commerce and many other applications powering every touchpoint.

Personalized insights and engagement are the layer that sits in between digital transformation and personalization at scale. To achieve personalization at scale and get the most out of your existing digital transformation efforts, there has to be a foundation. A foundation that understands and optimizes all the rich data you have and prepares that data for engagement across holistic customer journeys. Once you have the profile of the whole customer, you can personalize at scale.
