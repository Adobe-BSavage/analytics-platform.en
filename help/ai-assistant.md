# AI Assistant for Adobe Customer Journey Analytics

>[!NOTE]
>
>AI Assistant for Customer Journey Analytics is currently in Beta. The feature and its documentation are subject to change.

AI Assistant is a UI feature that you can use to navigate and understand Adobe Customer Journey Analytics concepts and terminology. The AI Assistant in Customer Journey Analytics is trained on its Adobe Experience League documentation. When asked a question, AI Assistant responds with a helpful answer that enables quick learning.

As a novice user, you can use AI Assistant to learn Customer Journey Analytics concepts and onboard yourself to products and features that you are unfamiliar with. As an experienced user, you can use AI Assistant to present more advanced use cases or tips and tricks.

Some examples of concept questions include:

* What is the difference between batch and streaming ingestion?
* What is Customer Journey Analytics best used for?
* How do I set up a data view?

The documentation retrieval model is trained on Customer Journey Analytics. Questions outside the scope of Customer Journey Analytics, such as questions about other Adobe products like Adobe Target and the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, cannot be answered.

AI Assistant for Customer Journey Analytics is available to all product tiers.

>At this point, AI Assistant for Customer Journey Analytics does not answer usage questions about data objects inside your organization.

## Feature Access

In this first release, access to the AI Assistant feature is governed by the following parameters:

* **Solution access**: The AI Assistant is available in Customer Journey Analytics, but not in Adobe Analytics. It is also available in Adobe Experience Platform, Adobe Journey Optimizer, Adobe Real-Time CDP and additional Experience Platform apps.

* **Contractual access**: Your Adobe sales contract needs to include a clause that allows Adobe to use your data in AI/ML model development.

* **Permissions**: The [!UICONTROL Adobe Admin Console] [!UICONTROL Reporting Tools] "AI Assistant Documentation" permission determines access to this tool. This permission will be added to the Reporting Tools section in mid May. You need to ensure that you create a [product profile](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-product-profiles.html) in Admin Console with this permission granted, and manually add users to this profile.
