| Setting | Description/Use case |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Format] | Lets you specify the formatting of a metric, as Decimal, Time, Percent, or Currency. |
| [!UICONTROL Decimal Places] | Lets you specify the number of decimal places a metric should display. |
| [!UICONTROL Show upward trend as] | Lets you specify whether an upward trend on this metric should be considered good (green) or bad (red). |
| [!UICONTROL Currency] | This setting appears only if the selected metric format is [!UICONTROL Currency]. A list of currency options are available. Defaults to no currency. This allows you to represent revenue in the currency of your choice in reporting. This is not a currency conversion, just a UI formatting option. |
