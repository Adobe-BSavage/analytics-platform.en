# Custom fields

You often need the ability to manipulate data before it is useful for reporting. In Adobe Analytics, tools like VISTA Rules, Processing Rules, Marketing Channels Processing Rules are available to accomplish this. These tools are not available in Customer Journey Analytics (CJA).

Custom fields in CJA allow you to make these often complex data manipulations on the fly through a customizable rule builder and apply the logic apply to your reporting. This can save a significant amount of time and effort compared to transforming your data in other locations such as Data Prep, Data Distiller or within your own ETL/ELT processes.
