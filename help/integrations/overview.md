# Integrate Adobe solutions with Customer Journey Analytics

Adobe offers many products and solutions that tap into data hosted on Adobe Experience Platform. You can use these guides to learn about the overarching workflows of getting that data into Analysis Workspace to run advanced reports.

Most workflows involve the following steps:

1. Use the desired solution or service to send data to Platform as a Dataset.
2. [Create a connection](/help/connections/create-connection.md) in Customer Journey Analytics with the desired Dataset.
3. [Create a data view](/help/data-views/create-dataview.md) containing the desired dimensions and metrics for use in reporting.
4. Run reports in Analysis Workspace based on the dimensions and metrics configured within the Data view.
