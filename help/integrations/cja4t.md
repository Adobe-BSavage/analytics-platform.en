# Integrate Target with Customer Journey Analytics

Adobe Target customers can configure Customer Journey Analytics as the reporting source. 

The primary benefits are:

* Marketers can dynamically apply Customer Journey Analytics success metrics to Target activity reports at any time. It is not required to specify everything before running the activity.
* Marketers can take advantage of Customer Journey Analytics features, such as the Experimentation Panel, to analyze their website personalization further.
* Marketers can have a single source of reporting for Adobe Journey Optimizer and Target. Both personalization products can be connected to Customer Journey Analytics for a more holistic view of your web personalization.

See [Target reporting in Adobe Customer Journey Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/target/using/integrate/cja/target-reporting-in-cja) in the Target documentation for more information.

See the [Experimentation panel](../analysis-workspace/c-panels/experimentation.md) for more information on how analysts can compare different user experience, marketing, or messaging variations to determine which is best at driving a specific outcome. You can evaluate the lift and confidence of any A/B experiment from any experimentation platform - online, offline, from Adobe solutions like Target or Journey Optimizer, and even BYO (bring-your-own) data.
