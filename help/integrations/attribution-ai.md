# Integrate Attribution AI with CJA

[Attribution AI](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/intelligent-services/attribution-ai/overview.html?lang=en), as part of Adobe Experience Platform Intelligent Services is a multi-channel, algorithmic attribution service that calculates the influence and incremental impact of customer interactions against specified outcomes. With Attribution AI, marketers can measure and optimize marketing and advertising spend by understanding the impact of every individual customer interaction across each phase of the customer journeys. 

Attribution AI supports two categories of scores: algorithmic and rule-based. Algorithmic scores include incremental and influenced scores. Rule-based scores include First touch, Last touch, Linear, U-shaped, and Time-Decay.

Attribution AI integrates with Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) to the extent that attribution models developed in Attribution AI can be leveraged in data views and reporting in CJA.
