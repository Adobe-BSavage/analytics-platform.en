# Integrate Adobe Journey Optimizer with Customer Journey Analytics

[Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/get-started/get-started.html) helps you deliver connected, contextual, and personalized experiences. It helps expose your customers to the next step in their customer journey.

You can import data generated by Journey Optimizer to perform advanced analysis in Customer Journey Analytics by performing the following steps:

## Send data from Journey Optimizer to Adobe Experience Platform

Adobe Experience Platform serves as the central data source and link between Journey Optimizer and Customer Journey Analytics. See [Get started with Datasets](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/data-management/datasets/get-started-datasets.html) in the Journey Optimizer user guide for steps on how to send Journey Optimizer data to Platform as a Dataset.

## Create a connection in Customer Journey Analytics

Once Journey Optimizer data is in Adobe Experience Platform, you can [Create a connection](/help/connections/create-connection.md) based on your Journey Optimizer Dataset. Select the Dataset that you sent to Platform.

## Configure the Data view to accommodate Journey Optimizer dimensions and metrics

After a connection is created, you can create one or more [Data Views](/help/data-views/create-dataview.md) to configure the desired dimensions and metrics available in Customer Journey Analytics.

You can create the following metrics in a data view to achieve approximate parity with similar metrics in Journey Optimizer. See [Component settings](/help/data-views/component-settings/overview.md) in the Data View Manager for details around how to customize dimensions and metrics.

| Metric | Description | Data View settings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bounces | The number of messages that bounced | Use the schema string element `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.messageDeliveryfeedback.feedbackStatus` with the following settings:<br>Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: If any criteria are met<br>Equals: `bounce`<br>Equals: `denylist` |
| Errors | The number of messages that errored out | Use the schema string element `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.messageDeliveryfeedback.feedbackStatus` with the following settings:<br>Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `error` |
| Excludes | The number of messages excluded | Use the schema string element `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.messageDeliveryfeedback.feedbackStatus` with the following settings:<br>Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `exclude` |
| Unsubscribes | The count of unsubscribes | Use the schema string element `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.messageInteraction.interactionType` with the following settings:<br>Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `unsubscribe` |
| Clicks | The count of clicks within messages | Use the schema string element `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.messageInteraction.interactionType` with the following settings:<br>Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `click` |
| Opens | The number of opened messages | Use the schema string element `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.messageInteraction.interactionType` with the following settings:<br>Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `open` |
| Spam complaints | The count of spam complaints | Use the schema string element `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.messageInteraction.interactionType` with the following settings:<br>Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `spam_complaint` |
| Messages successfully sent | The number of messages successfully sent | Use the schema string element `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.messageDeliveryfeedback.feedbackStatus` with the following settings:<br>Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `sent` |
| Sync failures | The total number of messages that failed to sync | Use the schema string element `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.messageDeliveryfeedback.messageFailure.category` with the following settings:<br>Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `sync` |

## Configure Calculated metrics using Journey Optimizer metrics

Once you have configured the desired dimensions and metrics for the Journey Optimizer dataset, you can also configure [Calculated metrics](/help/components/calc-metrics/calc-metr-overview.md) for additional insights around that data. These calculated metrics are based on the above metrics created in the Data View Manager.

| Calculated metric | Description | Formula |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total messages sent | The total number of messages sent, successful or failed | `[Messages successfully sent]` + `[Bounces]` + `[Sync failures]` |

## Differences in reporting between Journey Optimizer and Customer Journey Analytics

Data discrepancies between products is typically between 1-2%. Larger discrepancies between products can potentially be attributed to the following:

* Processing time for incoming data can be slightly different between products, especially for data collected within the last two hours. Use date ranges excluding today to mitigate discrepancies involving processing time.
* The calculated metric 'Total messages sent' does not include the 'Retries' metric. Data for the 'Retries' metric is not included in the Dataset, showing potentially lower numbers in CJA reporting versus AJO reporting. However, retry data is converged into the 'Messages successfully sent' or 'Bounces' metric. Use date ranges a week or older to mitigate discrepancies with the 'Total messages sent' metric between products.
