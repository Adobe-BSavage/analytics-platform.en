Adobe recommends creating an Experience Data Model (XDM) schema when upgrading to Customer Journey Analytics. An XDM schema allows for a streamlined schema that is tailored to the needs of your organization and the specific Platform applications that you use. When changes to the schema are required, you don't have to sift through thousands of unused fields to find the field that requires updating.  

Before you begin creating your XDM schema:

1. Identify your data team and other stakeholders throughout your organization.

1. Determine your organization's ideal schema design for Customer Journey Analytics, while taking into account any other Adobe Experience Platform applications used in your organization. 

1. Continue following the upgrade steps that were dynamically generated for your organization from the [Adobe Analytics to Customer Journey Analytics upgrade questionnaire](https://gigazelle.github.io/cja-ttv/).
