Classifications data

Classifications data from Adobe Analytics can be imported to the Experience Platform and Customer Journey Analytics using the Analytics Classifications Source Connector.

Lookup datasets can also be uploaded to Experience Platform directly and made available in Customer Journey Analytics.
