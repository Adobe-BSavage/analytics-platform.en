# Customer Journey Analytics glossary

Some Customer Journey Analytics terminology in Adobe Analytics differs from how it has traditionally been used in Adobe Analytics:

|Adobe Analytics term|CJA term|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Segment| Filter|...|
|Report Suite| N/A|Report suites in the traditional Adobe Analytics sense no longer exist. Instead, you create (virtual) data views from the Platform datasets that you established connections to.|
|Virtual report suite|Data view|A virtual report suite is a segmented view of a parent report suite. The main difference between a virtual report suite and a data view in CJA is that the virtual report suite is a subset of a "base" or "parent" report suite and, as such, inherited some of its settings. Since parent/base report suites no longer exist, you define data views with their own settings. |
|Classification|Lookup dataset|...|
|Customer attribute|Profile dataset|...|
