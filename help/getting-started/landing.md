## Navigate the [!UICONTROL Projects] tab {#navigate-projects}

[!UICONTROL Projects] serves as the [!UICONTROL Workspace] home page. Any Workspace projects show up here, including Mobile scorecards. **[!UICONTROL Projects]** are things that you have built or that someone else has built and shared with you. [!UICONTROL Projects] also refers to blank projects and blank mobile scorecards.
