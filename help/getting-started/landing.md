### Terminology 

* **[!UICONTROL Projects]** are customized designs that combine data components, tables, and visualizations that you built or that someone else built and shared with you. [!UICONTROL Projects] also refers to blank projects and blank mobile scorecards.
* **[!UICONTROL Reports]** refers to anything that was pre-built by Adobe, such as reports in Reports & Analytics and templates in Workspace.
* **[!UICONTROL Templates]** is no longer used as a term for Adobe's pre-built Workspace projects. They are now under [!UICONTROL Reports]. The term [!UICONTROL Templates] is still used for templates your company created.

## Navigate the [!UICONTROL Projects] tab {#navigate-projects}

[!UICONTROL Projects] serves as the [!UICONTROL Workspace] home page. The Projects tab displays the Company folder, any personal folders you created, your projects, and Mobile scorecards. Use this page to view, create, and modify folders, projects, and mobile scorecards. For more information, see [About Folders in Analytics](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/workspace-folders/about-folders.md).
