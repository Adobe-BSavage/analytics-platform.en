# Step 4: Retain historical data

Choose one of the following options to retain historical data when moving from Adobe Analytics to Customer Journey Analytics: 

## Utilize the Analytics Source Connector

  You can Utilize the [Analytics Source Connector](/help/data-ingestion/analytics.md) to retain historical data. Regardless of the migration method that you choose (even if you migrate using the Web SDK), you can use the Analytics Source Connector to retain historical data from your Adobe Analytics environment. 

  You can use the Analytics Source Connector to retain historical data in the following ways:
  
  * Bring historical data into its own dedicated location, separate from your current data.

  * Map historical data in a way that allows you to tie it to your new data. <!-- Possible? Explain -->

## Maintain your existing Adobe Analytics implementation

You can maintain your existing Adobe Analytics implementation alongside your new Customer Journey Analytics implementation for a specific time frame (for example, 1 year). When choosing this option, you must plan to decommission the Adobe Analytics implementation after you have sufficient data in Customer Journey Analytics. 

Contact your Adobe account representative to determine pricing for this option.
