# Frequently asked questions

|Question|Answer|
|---|---|
|Is stitching from anonymous behavior to authenticated behavior supported?|No, not yet.|
|Is it necessary to bring PII data to establish connections between the data?|No, you can use any ID, including a hash of a customer ID, which is not PII.|
|What happened to my old eVar setting?|EVars, props, and events in the traditional Adobe Analytics sense no longer exist in CJA. You have unlimited schema elements (dimensions, metrics, list fields ). So all of the attribution settings you used to apply during the data collection process are now applied at query time.|
|How long does it take to assemble dataset elements into a data view?| A few hours to get started, and a few days to backfill the last 13 months of data.|
