# View types overview

{{release-limited-testing}}

Guided analysis provides multiple ways to analyze data. These view types can show the same data in different ways, leading to different insights using the same events and segments. You get different query rails and visualization options depending on the view type that you choose. You can freely switch between view types, and any applicable query rail components carry over if the view type supports them.

Guided analysis categorizes view types into **Analysis types**. The following analysis and view types are available:

| Analysis type | View type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Funnel | [Friction](friction.md) | Compare conversion rates between steps. |
| Funnel | [Conversion trends](conversion-trends.md) | Track changes in conversion rates over time. |
| User growth | [Active](active.md) | Measure the growth of your user base. |
| User growth | [Net growth](net-growth.md) | Balance user gains and losses. |
| Trends | [Usage](usage.md) | Measure user engagement over time. |
