# Funnel

{{release-limited-testing}}

The **Funnel** [Analysis type](overview.md) provides a visual representation of a user journey or conversion process in your product. The horizontal axis represents each event that a user must touch in order. The vertical axis represents the percentage of users that touched each event. All touchpoints must be done in order, but can happen at any time within the reporting window. Use cases for this analysis type include:

* **Conversion analysis**: Funnel allows you to analyze conversions at each stage of the funnel. By tracking the number of users who progress from one step to the next, you can identify bottlenecks that have unusual or undesired conversion rates. This information is valuable to understand where you can improve your product for immediate results.
* **Onboarding optimization**: Funnel is helpful to help optimize your product's onboarding process. By examining user behavior around key events, you can identify which steps that users struggle with or fail to complete.
* **Feature adoption and engagement**: Funnel helps you understand how users interact with specific features in your product. By analyzing the progression of users through feature-related steps, you can assess feature adoption rates and identify areas where users might abandon or underuse certain features. You can then use this information to focus on feature or UI improvements to increase adoption rates.
* **Campaign evaluation**: Funnel can help measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. You can create a segment that focuses on users that touched a given campaign, and compare their conversion process with other campaigns or within your product overall.
