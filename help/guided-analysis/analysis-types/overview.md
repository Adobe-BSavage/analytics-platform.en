# Analysis types overview

{{release-limited-testing}}

Guided analysis projects provide several different ways to analyze data. These analysis types can show the same data in different ways, leading to different insights using the same events and segments. You get different query rails and visualization options depending on the analysis type that you choose. You can freely switch between analysis types, and any applicable query rail components carry over if the analysis type supports them.

Adobe offers the following analysis types in Guided analysis projects:

* **[Funnel](funnel.md)**: Identify areas of friction across a sequence of steps.
* **[User growth](user-growth.md)**: Track the growth of your product's user base.
* **[Trends](trends.md)**: Find patterns and changes in user engagement over time.
