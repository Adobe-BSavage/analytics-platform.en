# Guided Analysis overview

{{release-limited-testing}}

Guided Analysis is a reporting format that allows product teams to quickly self-serve their data needs to help them make more data-driven product decisions. Cross-functional teams can connect in real-time to use and understand these reports.

Similar to Analysis Workspace and Mobile scorecards, a Guided analysis report uses data from a [Data view](../data-views/data-views.md), which references data in Adobe Experience Platform through a [Connection](../connections/overview.md). All reports created in Guided Analysis can seamlessly transfer to Analysis Workspace for additional research.

Guided Analysis reports currently feature three analysis types: [Funnel](analysis-types/funnel.md), [Trends](analysis-types/trends.md), and [User growth](analysis-types/user-growth.md). Each of these analysis types have multiple view types, which provide additional insights to each of these reports.
