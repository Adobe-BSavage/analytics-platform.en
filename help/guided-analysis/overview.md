# Guided Analysis overview

Guided Analysis is a style of reporting that allows product teams to quickly self-serve their data needs to help them make more data-driven product decisions. Cross-functional teams can connect in real-time to use and understand these reports.

Similar to Analysis Workspace and Mobile scorecards, a Guided analysis report uses data from a [Data view](../data-views/data-views.md), which references data in Adobe Experience Platform through a [Connection](../connections/overview.md). All reports created in Guided Analysis can seamlessly transfer to Analysis Workspace for additional research.

## Provisioning

Guided Analysis is a paid add-on to Customer Journey Analytics. If your organization would like to start using this feature, contact your Adobe Account Team.
