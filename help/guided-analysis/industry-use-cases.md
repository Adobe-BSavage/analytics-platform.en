# Industry use cases

Let's take a look at the product team use cases that can be solved for with Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Product Analytics capabilities. 

+++**Retail**

| Theme | Use case | Impact | Reporting tools used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mobile Shopping App Optimization** | Many customers downloaded our mobile app but never came back. We found they were using it just for the initial offer and re-engaged those dormant customers. | **Increase LTV of mobile users.** Measure and increase app usage to get a more ‘happy path’ user experiences. | <ul><li> [Active user growth guided analysis](types/active.md) </li></ul> |
| **Quantify impact of new features in checkout process** | As a grocery store testing our way into online shopping, we can quickly measure the impact of new checkout features such as “Did you forget butter?” product recommendations or new methods for checkout such as Curbside Pickup. | **Increase conversion rates.** Measure business impact instead of just feature usage. | <ul><li> [Release impact guided analysis](types/release.md) </li></ul> |
| **Inefficient Internal Sales Journeys** | We uncovered inefficiencies in the journey of our in-store sales associates, where they were pulled away from customers. We adjusted their process; which gave customers a more enjoyable in-store shopping experience. | **Improve sales response.** Improve internal journeys to reduce inefficient processes; resulting in positive customer experiences. | <ul><li> [Friction guided analysis](types/friction.md) </li><li> [Flow visualization](../analysis-workspace/visualizations/c-flow/flow.md) </li></ul> |
| **Reduce Membership Churn** | We uncovered friction points in the customer journeys that cause customers to churn. This gave us the opportunity to review membership programs and analyze behaviors and signals of at-risk members. | **Reduce churn.** Identify ways to foster and nurture client relationships  to prevent attrition and reduce churn. | <ul><li> [Active user growth guided analysis](types/active.md) </li><li> [Friction guided analysis](types/friction.md) </li><li> [Flow visualization](visualizations/c-flow/flow.md) </li></ul> |

| **Gather insights for UX optimizations** | Our 5-step mobile claim process was driving calls into the call center. We quickly analyzed this, created an audience and sent an email to those customers to understand their experience." | **Isolate friction in the experience.** Improve “happy path” journeys and reduce calls. | <ul><li> [Friction guided analysis](types/friction.md) </li></ul> |
| **Quantify impact of new feature** | We recently rolled out bank transfers with Zelle, and we needed to understand the impact of the new feature on finishing transfers. Now that we can see how customers are reacting, the marketing team can roll it out. | **Increase conversion rates.** Measure impact of new feature on transfer conversions. | <ul><li> [Release impact guided analysis](types/release.md) </li></ul> |
| **Reduce customer churn** | We know that customers that log into the banking mobile app with monthly frequency remain customers longer. When we view our app user growth, we can identify who is at risk to churn and create a win-back strategy. | **Reduce churn.** Maintain level of customers while spending to acquire actual new customers. | <ul><li> [Active user growth guided analysis](types/active.md) </li><li> [Cohort visualization](../analysis-workspace/visualizations/cohort-table/cohort-analysis.md) </li></ul> |
| **New feature recommendation** | Digital withdrawals have decreased over time in lieu of calling a financial advisor. We’d like to optimize the digital process, and the trend data helps us prioritize the optimizations with a steering committee. | **Create a data-driven roadmap.** Leverage data to plan and implement optimizations | <ul><li> [Usage guided analysis](types/usage.md) </li></ul> |
