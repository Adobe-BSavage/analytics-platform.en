Frequently asked questions around Guided analysis.

+++**Is Guided analysis available to everyone?**

No; it is a paid add-on to CJA. If you would like to start using Guided analysis, contact your Adobe Account Team.

+++

+++**What implementation changes are required to use Guided analysis?**

If you are already using Analysis Workspace in CJA, no additional implementation changes are needed. Guided analysis reports use the same data view and connection data as workspace reports. The process to onboard and use any project type is identical for all of CJA, including Guided analysis.
