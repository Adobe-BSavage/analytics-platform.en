# Customer Journey Analytics Guardrails

This document provides static and soft limits for various components of Customer Journey Analytics. For performance guardrails, scoping parameters and entitlements, see the [Product Description for Customer Journey Analytics](https://helpx.adobe.com/legal/product-descriptions/customer-journey-analytics.html) or the [Product Description for Adobe Analytics Add-on: Customer Journey Analytics](https://helpx.adobe.com/legal/product-descriptions/adobe-analytics-addon-customer-journey-analytics.html).

Static and soft limits can be seen as guardrails, thresholds that provide guidance for data and system usage, performance optimization, and avoidance of errors or unexpected results in Customer Journey Analytics. 

Some of the features and their associated value for the static and soft limits are dependent on the Customer Journey Analytics package you are entitled to.
