# Estimate connection size

You may need to know how many rows of data you currently have in [!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics]. To get an accurate account of your organization's event data records (data rows) usage, do the following **for each of the connections created by your organization**.

1. In [!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics], click the **[!UICONTROL Connections]** tab. 

    You can now see a list of all your current connections.

1. Click each connection name to get to the Connections Manager.

1. Add up the **[!UICONTROL Records of event data available]** for all connections created. (Depending on the size of your connection, the number may take awhile to appear.)

1. Once you have a sum of all event data rows, look up the "Rows of Data" entitlement in the Customer Journey Analytics contract that your company signed with Adobe. 

    This gives you the maximum number of rows of data authorized in the Sales Order. If the number of rows of data that resulted from Step 3 is larger than this number, you are incurring an overage.

1. To remedy this situation, you have several options:

    * Change your [data retention settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-connections/manage-connections.html?lang=en#set-rolling-window-for-connection-data-retention).
    * [Delete any unused connections](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-overview/cja-faq.html?lang=en#implications-of-deleting-data-components).
    * [Delete a dataset in AEP](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-overview/cja-faq.html?lang=en#implications-of-deleting-data-components).
    * Contact your Adobe Account Manager to license additional capacity. 

## Regarding usage overages

Usage limits are regularly monitored and enforced by Adobe. “Rows of data” means the daily average rows of data available for analysis within Customer Journey Analytics.

For example, let’s say your contract entitles you to one million rows of data. Suppose that on day 1 of using Customer Journey Analytics, you upload two million rows of data. On day 2, you delete 1 million rows and keep your usage at that committed maximum (i.e., one million row of data) for the remainder of your License Term. Depending on your contractual terms, you may still incur prorated over-usage fees for day 1, since you exceeded your "rows of data" license entitlement.

## Diagnose discrepancies

In some cases, you may notice that the total number of events ingested by your connection is different than the number of rows in the dataset in [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform]. In this example, the dataset "B2B Impression" has 7650 rows, but the dataset contains 3830 rows in [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform]. There are several reasons why discrepancies can happen, and the following steps can be taken to diagnose:

1. Break down this dimension by **[!UICONTROL Platform Dataset ID]** and you will notice two datasets with same size but different **[!UICONTROL Platform Dataset IDs]**. Each dataset has 3825 records. That means [!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics] ignored 5 records due to missing person IDs or missing timestamps:

1. In addition, if we check in [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform], there is no dataset with Id "5f21c12b732044194bffc1d0", hence someone deleted this particular dataset from [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform] when the initial connection was being created. Later it got added to Customer Journey Analytics again, but a different [!UICONTROL Platform Dataset ID] was generated by [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform].
