# Cross-channel Analytics overview

**Journey IQ: Cross-channel Analytics** is a feature that allows you to re-key a visitor ID, which enables the stitching of multiple data sets together. CCA looks at user data from both authenticated and unauthenticated sessions to generate a stitched ID. Using Cross-channel Analytics, you can answer questions such as:

* How many people interact with my brand? How many and what types of devices do they use? How do they overlap?
* How often do people begin a task on a mobile device and then later move to a desktop PC to complete the task? Do campaign click-throughs that land on one device lead to conversion somewhere else?
* How does my understanding of campaign effectiveness change if I take into account cross-device journeys? How does my funnel analysis change?
* What are the most common paths users take from one device to another? Where do they drop out? Where do they succeed?
* How does the behavior of users with multiple devices differ from the users with a single device?

When devices are stitched, variable persistence is carried over across devices. For example, a user first visits your site through an advertisement on their desktop computer. That user finds your mobile app, installs it, and eventually makes a purchase on their mobile device. With Cross-channel Analytics, you can attribute revenue on the mobile device to the ad that they clicked on their desktop computer.

Out of a spirit of partnership and transparency, we want our customers to be aware of our use of Microsoft Azure in association with Cross-Device Analytics. Adobe uses Azure to store device graph data and to perform cross-device stitching. As such, Adobe Analytics data is passed back-and-forth between Adobe's data processing center and Adobeâ€™s provisioned instances of Microsoft Azure.

## Prerequisites

Before using Cross-channel Analytics, make sure that your organization is prepared with the following:

* Your data in Adobe Experience Platform must have two columns that help identify visitors:
  * A **persistent ID**, an identifier present on every row. For example, a visitor ID generated by an Adobe Analytics AppMeasurement library.
  * A **transient ID**, an identifier present on only some rows. For example, a hashed username or email address once a visitor authenticates.
* Adobe strongly recommends that you update your site to obtain the appropriate permissions from end-users to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

## Limitations

Cross-channel Analytics is a groundbreaking and robust feature, but has limitations on how it can be used.

* Current stitching capabilities are limited to one persistent ID and one transient ID. Support for multiple transient IDs, which would allow combining more than two datasets, is planned.

overarching workflow and the basics of how it works
- applied to event dataset
- involves re-keying said event dataset
- adds a new column (stitched id)
- you can use this column in the new dataset in data views for a better deduplicated (or stitched) metrics and attribution

include example of actual stitching with tables n' stuff




call account manager and request stitching be enabled for a specific dataset
- what data they want to stitch
- what is the persistent id (exists on every row, such as analytics visitor ID but it doesn't have to be, we don't discriminate)
- what is the transient id (exists on some rows, such as logged in user or email or customer id)
- account manager does their magic and enables stitching for that dataset. respond with the stitched dataset and the field containing stitched id
- create or edit a connection and add the stitched dataset to the connection. choose the new stitched field as the person id.

spits out an ID map and stitched dataset
can't use the ID map and point it to another dataset
