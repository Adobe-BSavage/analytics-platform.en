# Curator tasks

Curators may be organizational administrators or persons in other roles who are responsible for setting up app scorecards. Scorecards allow executive users to view a broad rendering of important summary data quickly and easily on their own mobile devices. Executive users are the end-users for Analytics dashboards. As a curator, you should complete these tasks to effectively set up the app for executives:

1. [Create scorecards for executives](/help/mobile-app/create-scorecard.md).
1. [Assist executives with app setup and using the app](/help/mobile-app/set-up-execs.md).
