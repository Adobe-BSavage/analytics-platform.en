# Analytics [!UICONTROL dashboards] - Overview

**Analytics [!UICONTROL dashboards]** provide anytime, anywhere insights from Customer Journey Analytics. The app allows users mobile access to intuitive scorecards. Mobile scorecards are a collection of key metrics and other components presented in a tiled layout that you can tap for more detailed breakdowns and trended reports. The mobile app is supported on both iOS and Android operating systems.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The mobile scorecard functionality offered in Customer Journey Analytics is almost identical to the functionality offered in Adobe Analytics. For this reason, the scorecard videos referred to in this page are showing the Adobe Analytics UI, not the Customer Journey Analytics UI. <br/><br/>Furthermore, although the mobile app is named Adobe Analytics in the app store, the app can be equally used with Customer Journey Analytics mobile scorecards.
