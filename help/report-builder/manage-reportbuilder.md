# Manage Data Blocks in Report Builder

You can view and manage all data blocks in a workbook using the Data Block Manager. The Data Block Manager provides search, filter, and sort capabilities that allow you to quickly locate specific data blocks. After selecting one or more data blocks, you can edit, delete, or refresh the selected data blocks.

## Search the Data Block list

Use the Search field to locate anything in the data block table. For example, you could search for metrics contained in the data blocks or report suite. You can also search for dates appearing in the date range, date modified, or last run date columns.

To verify if a data block is refreshed, view the refresh status icon. A checkmark in a green circle <img src="./assets/refresh-success.png" width="5%"/> indicates that the data block refresh was successful. A data block that has failed to refresh will display a warning icon <img src="./assets/refresh-failure.png" width="5%"/>.  This makes it easy to identify if any data blocks have errors.
