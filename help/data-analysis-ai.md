# Data Analysis AI Assistant in Customer Journey Analytics - Alpha

The Data Analysis AI Assistant is an intelligent, context-aware conversation agent that can help you more quickly and efficiently answer questions you may have of your Analysis Workspace data in Customer Journey Analytics. The Assistant looks through all the data in a data view, including the different types of metrics and components, and translates your prompt into the right dimension, metric, and date range for this analysis. Instead of having to familiarize yourself with the data view components, and then drag and drop those components in the best combination to answer your question, you can simply type the question into the AI Assistant.
